PATH is (P)HP (A)rrays (T)o (H)TML, which allows you to express HTML code as arrays written in a JSON-based shorthand, and converts these arrays into compressed HTML.
	easier to manipulate and search through server-side
	written less redundantly
	automatically determine things like self-closing tags
	language-agnostic: by exporting into JSON, you can write PATH in any language or even store in a db like mongo

For example:

<label id="myId" style="background:#000">this is my content</label> can be written as ['label#myId','style'=>'background:#000', 'this is my content']
